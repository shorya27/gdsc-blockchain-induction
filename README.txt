Problem Statement:
The challenge is to design a smart contract for a decentralized lottery application on the blockchain. Participants can participate in the lottery by paying a fixed fee within a specified timeframe. The smart contract employs cryptographic randomness to impartially select a winner, and the winnings are automatically transferred to the winner's address using the blockchain's transparent and trustless nature. The smart contract ensures that participants cannot enter the lottery more than once, preventing duplicity and ensuring fairness in the lottery process.

The above repo employs the solution for the above problem statement
The above file "Lottery.sol" is the induction task.This smart contract makes two different types of users the manager and the participants.The participants pay a price of 1 ether each to get 1 lottery ticket and once a random winner is choosen,the whole price pool is transfered to that participant.
